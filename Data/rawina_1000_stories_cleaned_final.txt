One day, while walking through the playground, Nino found a strange map hidden under a stone. It was old and faded, with markings leading to a mysterious place far beyond the usual trails.

Determined to uncover its secrets, Nino packed some snacks, said goodbye to friends, and began the journey. Along the way, Nino helped a baby bird back to its nest, gave water to a thirsty squirrel, and made a new friend—a cheerful hedgehog named Pip.
